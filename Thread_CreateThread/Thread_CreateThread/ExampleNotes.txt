A Mutex is like a C# lock, but it can work across multiple processes. In other words, 
Mutex can be computer-wide as well as application-wide.

A Mutex is a synchronization primitive that can also be used for interprocess synchronization. 
When two or more threads need to access a shared resource at the same time, the system needs a 
synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one thread at a time uses the resource. Mutex is 
a synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to the shared resource to only one 
thread. If a thread acquires a Mutex, the second thread that wants to acquire that Mutex is 
suspended until the first thread releases the Mutex.

In short, A mutual exclusion ("Mutex") is a mechanism that acts as a flag to prevent two threads 
from performing one or more actions simultaneously. The entire action that you want to run 
exclusively is called a critical section or protected section.

A critical section is a piece of code that accesses a shared resource (data structure or device) 
but the condition is that only one thread can enter in this section at a time.

Modern programming languages support this natively. In C#, it's as simple as:

    Instantiating a new static Mutex object that's accessible from each thread.
    Wrapping whatever code you want to be executed in the critical section with that object's 
    WaitOne() and ReleaseMutex() methods in each thread

With a Mutex class, you call the WaitHandle.WaitOne method to lock and ReleaseMutex to unlock. 
Closing or disposing a Mutex automatically releases it. Just as with the lock statement, a Mutex 
can be released only from the same thread that obtained it.

This example shows how a local Mutex object is used to synchronize access to a protected resource.
